# Statistical-Testing-on-correlation-of-COVID-19-in-South-Korea

COVID-19 has infected more than 10,000 people in South Korea.
KCDC (Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) announces the information of COVID-19 quickly and transparently.
This is a structured dataset based on the report materials of KCDC and local governments.
The project aims to find two associations: if the number of schools affect the number of Covid-19 cases & if the age of patients is correlated with the number of contact. I analyze and visualize the data using various visualization techniques and statistical tests.
